<h1>Here is the challenge</h1>

    <p>Choose a website you are <strong>familiar</strong> with and find one functionality of that website<br>
        that you want to <em>analyze</em>. One small piece of it, such as commenting on a post on a news site.<br>
        You could also pick searching for a product on an ecommerce site,<br>
        or liking a post on a social media site. Once you have selected the website and the functionality,<br>
        create a persona with a user story that can be used to develop a use case/interaction flow<br>
        that is uniform with strategic design guidelines.

        <h2>User Story</h2>

        <h2>Use Case</h2>
        <p>
            Sarah is a young professional living in a small studio apartment in New York City. She is a minimalist<br>
            who owns only the essentials and avoids clutter at all costs. Her clothing consists of a few high-quality<br>
            pieces that she can mix and match. She doesn't own a car and prefers to bike or walk everywhere.<br>
            Her apartment is sparsely furnished but filled with natural light and plants.<br>

            Sarah spends most of her free time practicing yoga, reading books, cycling, hiking, or exploring the city.<br>
            She prioritizes experiences over material possessions and values personal growth and self-improvement.<br>
            She is intentional about her purchases and only buys things that add value to her life.<br>

            Despite owning very little, Sarah feels content and fulfilled. She believes that living simply allows her to<br>
            focus on the things that matter most and live a more meaningful life.

            Recently, she attended a writing conference and took a photo with a well-known author that she would like to<br>
            share on her LinkedIn profile.<br>
